Title: Deploying your application
Content:
Once the development of your application is finished, you will need to
deploy it to the target machine, usually in the form of a package or
installer. You have several options here, and, even though this subject
is not really in the scope of this documentation, we will give some
hints to try to help you.
The first choice you need to make is whether you want to deploy your
application to more than one platform. If yes, then you have the choice
to use a different packaging system for each platform, or use one that
can deliver to all platforms simultaneously. This table summarizes the
pros and cons of each option.
<strong>Multiplatform packaging system</strong>
The same system is used to package your application for all platforms
You only need to develop your packaging system once, and it works for all supported platforms.
<strong>Single-platform packaging system</strong>
Your application is packaged using a different system on each platform.
You can make use of all the advantages each packaging system can offer.
You need to develop a new packaging system for each supported platform.
GStreamer itself supports many different platforms (Linux, iOS, Android, Mac
OS X, Windows, etc) and has been built using a multiplatform packaging
system named <strong>Cerbero</strong>, which is available for you to use, should you
choose to go down this route.
You can install GStreamer in the target machine in the same way
you installed it in your development machine, you can deploy it
privately, or you can even customize it before deploying. Here you have
a few options:
<strong>Shared GStreamer</strong>
GStreamer is installed independently of your application, as a prerequisite, in a common place in the target computer (<code>C:\Program Files</code>, for example). You application uses an environment variable to locate it.
<strong>Private GStreamer with dynamic linking</strong>
Your application deploys GStreamer to a private folder.
<strong>Private GStreamer with static linking</strong>
Your application links statically against GStreamer, so it effectively becomes part of your application binary.
The following pages give further directions for some of the above
options.
